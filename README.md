Project one for TTH iOS Techdegree

Very simply, this is my first project for the iOS degree at Treehouse.

Following are the steps of the challenge:

Manually create a single collection named 'players' that contains all information for all 18 players. 
Each player must themselves be represented 
by a Dictionary with String keys and the corresponding values.

Create appropriate variables and logic to sort and store players into t
hree teams: Sharks, Dragons and Raptors. Store the players for each team in collection 
variables named 'teamSharks', 'teamDragons', and 'teamRaptors'. Be sure that your logic 
results in all teams having the same number of experienced players on each.

Provide logic that prints a personalized letter to the guardians 
specifying: the player’s name, guardian names, team name, and date/time of their 
first team practice. The values for each should exactly match what we have 
provided, including the team practice dates and times above. The letters must be 
stored in a collection variable named 'letters'. When the code is run, the letters 
should be printed in the console. You might find out that the word “Optional” is 
being printed in the output (e.g. Optional(“John Doe”). This is related to a feature 
in Swift called Optional Variables. Try doing a bit of 
research (Hint: search for Swift Optionals Unwrapping)



As always, please add concise and descriptive comments to your code and be sure 
to name your constants, variables, keys, and methods descriptively and relevant to the project.



Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off 
all of the items on the Student Project Submission Checklist. The checklist is designed 
to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements and that your project 
is complete and ready to be submitted!



Extra Credit

1 step

Logic to ensure that each team's average height is within 1.5 inch of the others 
as well as having each team contain the same number of experienced players. Your logic 
should be make use of dynamic values like the average height of teams or players and 
not be based on any magic numbers or hard-coded values. You should not rely on a particular
ordering of the initial collection of players - the logic should work regardless of the order
of players in the initial collection. (Please note, this feature only needs to meet the 
1.5 inch threshold for the given set of players we provided, not for all potential 
future sets of players.) Please also print out the average height of the players of each team. 
If you do not want to be considered for an “Exceeds Expectations” rating, you may skip this step.
